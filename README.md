Data_cleaning And preprocessing
Data_Visualization
Model_Traning
Importing libraries
Here i used libraries like numpy for arithmatics used , pandas for reading files and other uses, matplotlib for plotting , seaborn for visualization the data and and import form sklearn the model i used (Logistic Reression )
Pipeline,train_test_split,KFold,cross_val_score,accuracy_score,f1_score,confusion_matrix,ConfusionMatrixDisplay

Read_data
Iam reading the dataset form my PC

Data_Exoplaration
here i'am trying to understand the data and generate the maximum information from it by get the info () and the description of the mathimatical data and find outliers and find null values and the quantiles of the data and calculate the distinct values of specific columns .

Data_Visualization
here i make a fuction that generate relation plot of kind scatter plot that give us the intuition of the relation between "Output" and other columns .

Model_Traning
here i chosse Logistic Regression () model to predict the future input
